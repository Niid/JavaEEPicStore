                <h2>Here are some lyrics just so this page isn't empty</h2>
                <h3>Beck - Loser (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgSPaXgAdzE)</h3>
                <p>In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
                    Butane in my veins so I'm out to cut the junkie
                    With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
                    Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
                    Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
                    Stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control
                    Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D</p>
                <p>Got a couple of couches sleep on the love seat
                    Someone keeps sayin' I'm insane to complain
                    About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
                    Don't believe everything that you read
                    You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
                    So shave your face with some mace in the dark
                    Savin' all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park</p>
                <p>Soy un perdedor
                    I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me?</p>
                <p>Soy un perdedor
                    I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me?</p>
                <p>Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
                    Banned all the music with a phony gas chamber
                    Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
                    One's got on the pole shove the other in a bag
                    With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job</p>
                <p>The daytime crap with the folksinger slop
                    He hung himself with a guitar string
                    Slap the turkey neck and it's hangin' from a pigeon wing
                    You can't write if you can't relate
                    Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
                    And my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite
                    Who's chokin' on the splinters</p>
                <p>Soy un perdedor
                    I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me?
                    (Get crazy with the Cheeze Whiz)</p>
                <p>Soy un perdedor
                    I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me?
                    (Drive-by body pierce)</p>
                <p>Soy
                    (I'm a driver I'm a winner things are gonna change I can feel it)</p>
                <p>Soy un perdedor
                    I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me?
                    (I can't believe you)</p>
                <p>Soy un perdedor
                    I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me?</p>
                <p>Soy un perdedor

                <p>Soy un perdedor
                    I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me?
                    (Know what I'm sayin'?)</p>
